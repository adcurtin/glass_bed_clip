# Glass Bed Clip

This is a clip to allow for easily swappable glass beds on a Powerspec 3D Pro printer (a clone of the FlashForge Creator Pro, which is a clone of the Replicator 1).

# Printing

I print at 90% infill (do not print at 100%, you need a little flexibility).  
use supports.  
0.2mm layer height is just fine.  

Print two copies of backboard.stl and one of glass_bed_clip.stl (all 3 parts).

**Do not move or reorient the clips**, they are very sensitive to 'grain' direction and layer orientation.

# Use

I put the 2 backboards on the back corners of the bed. I put the multi piece clip on the front left corner (but front right works too).

the side of the clip that goes toward the bed has 2 things that jut out. The bottom one goes below the bed, and keeps the clips from riding too high above the bed. The top one goes right on top of the metal bed and pushes against the side of the glass.

Below the bed, I have a spring that goes between the two long columns that stick out below the clips. Below the spring is the 3rd piece from glass_bed_clip.stl, the lever. This is so the spring puts more compression on the top of the clip, rather than twisting the levers toward the bottom of the bed.

I replaced the stock screws that hold the metal plate to the PCB heater with longer ones on the corners with extra stuff installed. I used T-nuts on the bottom of the backboards and the bed clip to really secure them in place.


Both the lever and the below the bed guides are necessary for this clip to work for any length of time, but with both of them, this has been installed on my printer for over a year and still works great.
